Kaggle ML and Data Science Survey-2021 (Kaggle Competition) -Analytical

•	Libraries – Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly and NumPy.
•	Dataset – Kaggle Survey Data -2021,2020,2019

Objective of the project is to find insights from the Kaggle ML and Data Science Survey-2021 data.
In order to get more information, I used the same type survey data from the years 2018,19,20 
This helps to understand more about the decline and gain in popularity of Kaggle in some of the countries and its reasons.
With the same data we can recommend which domain Kaggle learning need to add in future to attract more users.
Some of the plots used for Analysis can be seen below.

Value Addition 
This project helps me to understand more about the concepts of finding the insights from a data. The more you spend and visualize the more questions will arise whose answers gives us more insights about the data. Also, it helped to enhance my skills in Data analytics (Pandas) and Data Visualization (Seaborn/Plotly).
